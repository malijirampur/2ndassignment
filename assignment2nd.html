    <h1>Features of HTML</h1>
    <p>HTML5 has two crucial additions: audio and video tags. It enables web developers to include a video or audio file on their pages. The video element in HTML5 may be styled using CSS and CSS. Borders, opacity, reflections, gradients, transitions, transformations, and even animations may all be changed. YouTube also declares video embedding by providing the code to use to embed their videos on other websites. It contributes to the web being increasingly engaged with multimedia. HTML5 includes a new element, the audio tag, which is accessible for use, which is used to embed any audio file into a webpage on the Internet. These new tags eliminate the requirement for a div> tag to separate the two parts. The footer appears at the bottom of the page, whereas the header appears at the top. The browser will know what to load first and what to load later if you use the HTML5 elements header and footer.</p>
    <h2>HTML entity</h2>
    <p>An HTML entity is a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand (&) and ends with a semicolon (;). Entities are frequently used to display reserved characters (which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code), and invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces). You can also use them in place of other characters that are difficult to type with a standard keyboard.</p>
    <h2>web accessibility</h2>
    <p>When websites and web tools are properly designed and coded, people with disabilities can use them. However, currently many sites and tools are developed with accessibility barriers that make them difficult or impossible for some people to use. Making the web accessible benefits individuals, businesses, and society. International web standards define what is needed for accessibility.</p>
    <h3>improving the web accessibility</h3>
    <p>Add proper alt text to images.
        Use alt text to provide access to the content of images for individuals who cannot see them, including people using screen readers or Braille output devices. Alt text is supported by most document formats, including HTML, Microsoft Word, and Adobe PDF. For more information, see the UW Accessible Technology page Making Images Accessible.
        
        Use headings properly.
        Use headings and subheadings to form an outline of the page. Do not skip heading levels. They help non-visual users (including search engines) to understand how the page is organized, and make it easy for screen reader users to navigate. For more information, see the UW Accessible Technology page Providing Structure in Web Pages and Documents.
        
        Create accessible PDFs.
        Use "tagged PDF", the only type of PDF that supports headings and alt text for images. Use the PDF Accessibility Checker that’s provided by Adobe Acrobat. For more information, see the UW Accessible Technology page Creating Accessible Documents.
        
        </p>
        <h2>Tab index</h2>
        <p>The tabindex attribute specifies the tab order of an element (when the "tab" button is used for navigating).

            The tabindex attribute can be used on any HTML element (it will validate on any HTML element. However, it is not necessarily useful).</p>
            <h2>Semantics</h2>
            <p>In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code — for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)</p>
            <h3>Benefits of semantics tags</h3>
            <p>The semantic HTML tags help the search engines and other user devices to determine the importance and context of web pages.
                The pages made with semantic elements are much easier to read.
                It has greater accessibility. It offers a better user experience.</p>
